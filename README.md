JSF2-SQL-read-write-image
=========================

This is a JSF 2 application. We are using a Primefaces component library. Application displays form which allows you to enter an image path from your local drive and send it to the server. There is a bean responsible for storing image send via the form. There is also an image tag present on the sample site. Last uploaded image is being read by the servlet and send to the servlet output. This servlet is pointed to in the URL attribute of the image tag. Use this code any way you want.
